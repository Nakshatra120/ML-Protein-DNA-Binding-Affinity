#Sample input file for GB calculation
#This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Although, we tried to use the input files as #recommended in the
#Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of #time. Feel free to change the parameters
#according to what is better for your system.
